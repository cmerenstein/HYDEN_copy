This program is designed to implement the highly degenerate primer design algorithm described by Linhart and Shamir: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951798

The complete paper that this program is based on can be found on researchgate: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/42976269_Degenerate_Primer_Design__Theoretical_Analysis_and_the_HYDEN_Program

The HYDEN program is free but not open-source, and can be found here: http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/hyden/HYDEN.htm

This is a work in progress. As of initial commit, only the first stage, the h-align algorithm, is functional.
There is no guarantee about the functionality of this program or the algorithm, this code is mostly for my own education.
